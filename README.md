some scripts for automated/mass adding to myanimelist

## mangahere --> myanimelist
first go to mangahere bookmarks and save the html code by viewing source. save as ```1.html```, ```2.html```, etc.

open ```mangahere_title.py``` and edit the range for the number of html pages. Run.

now run ```mangahere.py```.

The delay can be made shorter/longer if requests are going through/rejected.

If it can't find the manga, it'll open up the search of that manga in the browser.
